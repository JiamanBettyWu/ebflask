This is a flask web application for language translation. We built an interactive website that allows users to translate the words/sentences with specified languages immediately. This is a serverless web application built on cloud with continuous intergradation and deployment. Check out the website [here](http://flask-env.eba-7pasacfp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
